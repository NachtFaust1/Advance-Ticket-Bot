<h1 align="center">🎫 Ticket Prime</h1>

Ticket Prime is a discord bot focused on managing tickets channels your discord server(s). This bot is the old version of our new Ticket Prime, so I decided to open source this project since I don't need it anymore.

### Features 🔥

Here are some of the features of this system.

1. **Highly customisable**    
You can customize everything you want about the bot, its messages, embeds, buttons and more.

2. **Easy to configure**    
Very easy to configure.

3. **Multi server system**     
The bot is optimized to work with many servers at the same time, so if you own multiple servers you won't have to host a bot for each one

4. **Transcription system**
When you close a ticket it will send you a DM or send a transcript on a channel you setup.

### Dependencies 🔗
